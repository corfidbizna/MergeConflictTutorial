Once upon a time, there was a angry-faced dragon-goat.

This dragon-goat was white, for the most part. White scales covered its whole body.

It was a doctor in another life, so it wore a white lab coat and stethescope. 

However, the outfit was not as doctor-ish as it was in that other life, because the outfit was covered in zippers. 

This dragon-goat had a friend. A tall, anime-ish person. This person was silly, and was named Sora.

Sora constantly berated the dragon-goat for not dishing out enough healing spells during battle, even though the dragon-goat was doing a darn good job at it. 

The dragon-goat's other friend—a tall, lanky dog named Dippy—was never mean to the dragon-goat and was always giving compliments. 

"You're doin' great, a-hyuck," he would say. "Thanks, pal!"

This made the dragon-goat's life worth living, even though half his friends (though half of two is very small) thought he wasn't doing good enough.
