Once upon a time, there was a creature. 
This creature was white, for the most part. White feathers covered its whole body.
It was a sailor in another life, so it wore blue salor-ish shirt and hat. 
However, this shirt and hat combination was not as salor-ish as it was in that other life, so they were covered in zippers.
