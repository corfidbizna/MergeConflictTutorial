# The Story of the dragon-goat, Sora, Goofy, and the Pink Witch

Once upon a time, there was a angry-faced dragon-goat.

This dragon-goat was white, for the most part. White scales covered its whole body.

It was a doctor in another life, so it wore a white lab coat and stethescope. 

However, the outfit was not as doctor-ish as it was in that other life, because the outfit was covered in zippers. 

This dragon-goat had a friend. A tall, anime-ish person. This person was silly, and was named Sora.

Sora constantly berated the dragon-goat for not dishing out enough healing spells during battle, even though the dragon-goat was doing a darn good job at it. 

The dragon-goat's other friend—a tall, lanky dog named Goofy—was never mean to the dragon-goat and was always giving compliments. 

"You're doin' great, a-hyuck," he would say. "Thanks, pal!"

This made the dragon-goat's life worth living, even though half his friends (though half of two is very small) thought he wasn't doing good enough.

"I don't wanna practice anymore!" said the dragon-goat.

Sora frowned. "You're gonna have to keep on going," he said. "How else are we all gonna learn?"

"Ahh, phooey!" said the dragon-goat.

## The Pink Witch

One day the dragon-goat and Sora were walking down the road, when they were suddenly approached by a witch in a pink hat and cloak. She smiled at them and said, "Hello!". The dragon-goat and Sora said "Hello" to the pink witch, and continued on their way.

"That witch sure was pink!" said the dragon-goat. Then he sneezed.

King Mickey drove past them all on a vespa. Everyone was surprised. Especially Xehanort.

King Mickey, in his haste to get back to the castle, crashed into the Pink Witch with a "KERSPLOW-BA-BOOOM!"

"Oh no! The Pink Witch!" shouted the Goofy.

The dragon-goat waved his hand dismissively, "Ah, phooey. That's what she gets getting in the way of His Majesty, King Mickey."

Meanwhile, King Mickey laughed maniachally in the distance.
