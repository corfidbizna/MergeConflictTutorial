Once upon a time, there was a angry-faced dragon. 

This dragon was white, for the most part. White scales covered its whole body.

It was a doctor in another life, so it wore a white lab coat and stethescope. 

However, the outfit was not as doctor-ish as it was in that other life, so they were covered in zippers. 

He had a friend. A tall, lanky dog. This dog was silly, and was named Goofy.
