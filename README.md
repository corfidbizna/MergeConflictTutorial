Once upon a time, there was an angry-faced duck. 
This duck was white, for the most part, as he was covered in white feathers. His feet were orange though. 
Anyway, this duck was a sailor in another life, so he wore blue salor-ish shirt and hat.  
However, this shirt and hat combination was not as salor-ish as it was in that other life, as these clothes were now covered in zippers. They were still blue though.
