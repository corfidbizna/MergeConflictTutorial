# The Story of the dragon-goat, Sora, Goofy, and the Pink Witch

Once upon a time, there was a angry-faced dragon-goat.

This dragon-goat was white, for the most part. White scales covered its whole body.

It was a doctor in another life, so it wore a white lab coat and stethescope. 

However, the outfit was not as doctor-ish as it was in that other life, because the outfit was covered in zippers. 

This dragon-goat had a friend. A tall, anime-ish person. This person was silly, and was named Sora.

Sora constantly berated the dragon-goat for not dishing out enough healing spells during battle, even though the dragon-goat was doing a darn good job at it. 

The dragon-goat's other friend—a tall, lanky dog named Goofy—was never mean to the dragon-goat and was always giving compliments. 

"You're doin' great, a-hyuck," he would say. "Thanks, pal!"

This made the dragon-goat's life worth living, even though half his friends (though half of two is very small) thought he wasn't doing good enough.

"I don't wanna practice anymore!" said the dragon-goat.

Sora frowned. "You're gonna have to keep on going," he said. "How else are we all gonna learn?"

"Ahh, phooey!" said the dragon-goat.

## The Pink Witch

One day the dragon-goat and Sora were walking down the road, when they were suddenly approached by a witch in a pink hat and cloak. She smiled at them and said, "Hello!". The dragon-goat and Sora said "Hello" to the pink witch, and continued on their way.

"That witch sure was pink!" said the dragon-goat. Then he sneezed.

King Mickey drove past them all on a vespa. Everyone was surprised. Especially Xehanort.

King Mickey, in his haste to get back to the castle, crashed into the Pink Witch with a "KERSPLOW-BA-BOOOM!"

"Oh no! The Pink Witch!" shouted Sora.

The dragon-goat waved his hand dismissively, "Ah, phooey. That's what she gets getting in the way of His Majesty, King Mickey."

Meanwhile, King Mickey laughed maniachally in the distance. 

## The Green Dinosaur 

One day, when Sora, Dragon-Goat, and Goofy were walking down the road, they passed a green dinosaur walking opposite them. 

On closer inspection, the dinosaur wasn't actually walking *towards* them, but just marched in place facing down the road.  

Sora waved at the dinosaur, jogging up to it so as to greet it properly. Before he could say anything, he noticed that the dinosaur was emitting a pleasant melody had a nice little rhythm. It was to this melody that the dinosaur was marching. 

The dragon-goat and Goofy caught up to Sora. 

"Hello there? What's that you're doing in the middle of the road?" asked Dragon-Goat. 

The green dinosaur suddenly opened its mouth. The sound it made carried no meaning, but it seemed melodious as if it was singing along to the phantom song. 

The three friends looked at each other, confused.  

The sound the green dinosaur made with its throat seemed to… never cease. It just kept holding that note, marching to the beat of the song. 

Sora looked at Dragon-Goat, who looked at Goofy, who looked at Sora, then Sora looked at Goofy, then he at Dragon-Goat, then he at Sora, and they all nodded. 

They left the singing(?) dinosaur alone and continued on their way.  

As they continued down the road, they found a long string of white eggs with green circular splotches on them. 

Some of the eggs had been shattered and lay besides debris of various things, as though they were thrown violently at them. 

Other eggs were bouncing vigorously. 

Dragon-Goat picked up one of the bouncing eggs and accidently crushed it (which is why he's no longer allowed in Little Chef's bistro in Twilight Town). The egg was completely hollow, despite its earlier movement. He threw the shattered remains of the eggshell to the ground, exclaiming loudly in an incoherent fassion. 

The lone-held note from the green dinosaur at this point seemed like a haunting wail having been held breathlessly for so long.

Dragon-Goat, Sora, and Goofy decided the best place to be was Not Here™, so they took off down the road as fast as their varying-sized legs would carry them.
