# The Story of the dragon-goat, Goofy, and the Pink Witch

Once upon a time, there was a angry-faced dragon-goat.

This dragon-goat was white, for the most part. White scales covered its whole body.

It was a doctor in another life, so it wore a white lab coat and stethescope. 

However, the outfit was not as doctor-ish as it was in that other life, because the outfit was covered in zippers. 

He had a friend. A tall, lanky dog. This dog was silly, and was named Goofy.

One day the dragon-goat and Goofy were walking down the road, when they were suddenly approached by a witch in a pink hat and cloak. She smiled at them and said "Hello!". The dragon-goat and Goofy said "Hello" to the pink witch, and continued on their way.

"That witch sure was pink!" said the dragon-goat.

King Mickey drove past them all on a vespa. Everyone was surprised.
