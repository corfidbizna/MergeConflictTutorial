Once upon a time, there was an angry-faced Goat.

This Goat was white, for the most part, as he was covered in white feathers. His feet were orange though.

Anyway, this Goat was a sailor in another life, so he wore blue salor-ish shirt and hat.

However, this shirt and hat combination was not as salor-ish as it was in that other life, as these clothes were now covered in zippers. They were still blue though.

He had a friend. A tall, lanky dog. This dog was silly, named Goofy.
