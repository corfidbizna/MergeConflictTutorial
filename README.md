Once upon a time, there was a dragon. 
This dragon was white, for the most part. White scales covered its whole body.
It was a doctor in another life, so it wore a white lab coat and stethescope. 
However, the outfit was not as doctor-ish as it was in that other life, so they were covered in zippers.
